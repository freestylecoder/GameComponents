This is a shared project that I use for most of my XNA talks. It contains all the game components I use across multiple talks.

The initial revision of this repository includes the code that was used at CodeMash 2013. I will try to to remember to tag, as necessary, to make sure people can find the state of the demo code that matches a particular event.

This project assumes you have Visual Studio 2010 and Game Studio 4 installed on your system. If you are having problems installing Game Studio 4 on Windows 8, refer to the slide deck for instructions.

NOTE: This code is meant to be used as a teaching tool. As such, there are a few places where code is structured for clarity, not efficency. Over time, I will try to add comments that explain how certain things should "really" be done.
